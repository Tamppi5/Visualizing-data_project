I have a lot of other stuff to do so I haven't started making the project yet.

I still have not started the project due to being very busy in this period. I look forward to starting the project in near future so that I have something to show when we have our next briefing in zoom.

I am just starting to look into the program. My exam week is just over so I haven't been able to make the project any further just yet.
I planned that the project would take about 30 hours to make. I have 2 weeks left so I will need to use approximately 15 hours on the project per week.
I am sorry that it took me a while to get started :D

Today I worked on the project for about 2.5 hours to set up the intellj. I tried the scalafx and interface commands.
